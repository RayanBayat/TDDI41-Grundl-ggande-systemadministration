/etc/ypserv.securenets filen :


#
# securenets    This file defines the access rights to your NIS server
#               for NIS clients (and slave servers - ypxfrd uses this
#               file too). This file contains netmask/network pairs.
#               A clients IP address needs to match with at least one
#               of those.
#
#               One can use the word "host" instead of a netmask of
#               255.255.255.255. Only IP addresses are allowed in this
#               file, not hostnames.
#
# Always allow access for localhost
255.0.0.0       127.0.0.0

# This line gives access to everybody. PLEASE ADJUST!
0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0
255.255.255.0   10.0.0.0

/etc/yp.conf


#
# yp.conf       Configuration file for the ypbind process. You can define
#               NIS servers manually here if they can't be found by
#               broadcasting on the local net (which is the default).
#
#               See the manual page of ypbind for the syntax of this file.
#
# IMPORTANT:    For the "ypserver", use IP addresses, or make sure that
#               the host is in /etc/hosts. This file is only interpreted
#               once, and if DNS isn't reachable yet the ypserver cannot
#               be resolved and ypbind won't ever bind to the server.

# ypserver ypserver.network.com
domain nis.example.com server server.example.com
